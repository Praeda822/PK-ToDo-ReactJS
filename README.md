## Overview

PKs **To Do List** application is a React-based project designed to help users manage tasks effectively. It leverages Reactâ€™s `useState` hook for state management and provides core functionalities such as adding, deleting, and reordering tasks. This ReadMe not only documents the applicationâ€™s features but also offers detailed explanations of its components and underlying React concepts to ensure clarity for both beginners and seasoned developers.

### Still To Do

1. Add either **localStorage** or **sessionStorage** integration to save tasks after page refresh. **[ ]**
2. Allow users the ability to edit existing tasks within the list. **[ ]**
3. Add a _time submitted_ field that works off the in-built geolocation API. **[ ]**
4. Implement a UI/UX library like **Material-UI** to enhance application aesthetic. **[ ]**
5. Add animations for task addition, deletion, and reordering. **[ ]**
6. Implement error handling for empty task submission & improved UX. **[ ]**
7. Let Lozza muck around with the app to find the bugs I never would have thought of. **[ ]**

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can input tasks into a text field and add them to the list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking a "Delete" button.
- **Reorder Tasks**:
  - Move tasks up using the ğŸ”¼ button.
  - Move tasks down using the ğŸ”½ button.
- **Dynamic State Management**: Uses React's `useState` to manage the application state in real time.

## How It Works

### React's `useState` Hook

`useState` is a React hook that allows functional components to maintain state. In my app I've used it to manage:

1. `tasks`, an array that stores the list of tasks.
2. `newTask`, an array that stores the value of the current task being typed into the input field.

#### React's `useState` Hook: `""` vs. `[]` Arguments

- Arrays are ideal for storing multiple tasks and allow easy data manipulation through methods like `.map()` and `.filter()`.
- **Empty String (`""`)**, an empty string represents the initial string value state of `newTask` to ensure the input field is cleared after a task has been added.
- **Empty Array (`[]`)**, an empty array represents the initial state value of `tasks` because the list of tasks will initially be empty.

### Callback Functions and Arrow Functions

When I directly invoke a function (`onClick={deleteTask(index)}`), that function will execute immediately upon rendering, and if I want to prevent this, I need to use an **arrow function** (`onClick={() => deleteTask(index)}`), which will delay that function's execution call _until_ the button is clicked.

## Application Structure

### Input Handling

#### `handleInputChange`

Updates the `newTask` state whenever the user types into the input field.

```javascript
function handleInputChange(event) {
  setNewTask(event.target.value);
}
```

### Adding Tasks

#### `addtask` & Updater Functions: What is an Updater Function?

- An updater function ensures that any state updates are based on the previously enumerated state (_t, in this case_) and this is crucial when working with asynchronous state updates as React _batches_ state updates for performance.
- `addtask` checks if the input isnâ€™t empty by checking the current state of the `newTask` array, (`newTask.trim() !== ""`).
- `addtask` then uses an **updater function** that takes in the current state of tasks and returns a new state (`t`): `setTasks((t) => [...t, newTask])`.

### Task Management

#### `deleteTask`

- `deleteTask` uses the `filter` method to remove a task from the list.
- If the current index of `i` isn't equal to index I want to delete then put the state value of `i` into the new array of tasks, `newTask,` and update the state of `tasks` with this new array by using the `setTasks` setter function.
- If they match, filter them out (_delete them_).

```javascript
function deleteTask(index) {
  const updatedTasks = tasks.filter((_, i) => i !== index);
  setTasks(updatedTasks);
}
```

#### `moveTaskUp` & `moveTaskDown`

- `moveTaskUp` and `moveTaskDown` use the `map` method to reorder tasks.
- Both functions take in the current index of the task to be moved and create a new array of tasks, `updatedTasks`
- Then I create a new array of tasks, `updatedTasks`, to store the updated list of tasks.
- Then I used _array destructuring_ to swap the positions of the current index and the index either before and/or after it, respectively.
- Finally, I update the state of `tasks` with the new array of `updatedTasks`.

```javascript
if (index > 0) {
  const updatedTasks = [...tasks];
  [updatedTasks[index], updatedTasks[index - 1]] = [
    updatedTasks[index - 1],
    updatedTasks[index],
  ];
  setTasks(updatedTasks);
}
```
